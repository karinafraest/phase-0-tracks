  <p><strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</strong></p>
  <p>Semantic tags are used to give structure to an HTML file. All of them could be replaced with divs but they make identification easier, so they are all equally important. The ones I have seen most in regular pages are: main, nav, header and footer. </p>
  <p> <strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong></p>
  <p>Browser loads whatever is in head first. Then all the body elements from top to bottom with the images and other external elements (like a google map) at the end</p>
  <p><strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</strong></p>
  <p>I realized that Sublime can help you OR make you really lazy. I might add more snippets once I know what I'll be doing almost always.</p>
  <p><strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</strong></p>
  <p>I think all of the concepts are clear to me. </p>
