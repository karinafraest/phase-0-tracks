Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
sqlite> SELECT * FROM ice_cream;
1|Strawberry|300|1
2|Strawberry|300|2
3|Chocolate|300|2
4|Vanilla|100|1
5|Vanilla|400|4
6|Tequila|150|5
7|Mint Chocolate|140|3

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> UPDATE ice_cream SET type_id=1 WHERE id=3;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM ice_cream;
1|Strawberry|300|1
2|Strawberry|300|2
3|Chocolate|300|1
4|Vanilla|100|1
5|Vanilla|400|4
6|Tequila|150|5
7|Mint Chocolate|140|3

Display the information in both tables using one query.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM ice_cream, type_of_ice_cream WHERE ice_cream.type_id = type_of_ice_cream.id;
1|Strawberry|300|1|1|Milk based
2|Strawberry|300|2|2|Water based
3|Chocolate|300|1|1|Milk based
4|Vanilla|100|1|1|Milk based
5|Vanilla|400|4|4|Organic
6|Tequila|150|5|5|Alcohol
7|Mint Chocolate|140|3|3|Low Fat

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
sqlite> SELECT ice_cream.flavor, type_of_ice_cream.type FROM ice_cream JOIN type_of_ice_cream ON ice_cream.type_id= type_of_ice_cream.id;
Strawberry|Milk based
Strawberry|Water based
Chocolate|Milk based
Vanilla|Milk based
Vanilla|Organic
Tequila|Alcohol
Mint Chocolate|Low Fat

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> DELETE FROM ice_cream WHERE type_id=5;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM ice_cream;
1|Strawberry|300|1
2|Strawberry|300|2
3|Chocolate|300|1
4|Vanilla|100|1
5|Vanilla|400|4
7|Mint Chocolate|140|3
