Game Scorer
This is a simple program that creates a database to store games, players and scores. 
It is created thinking specifically for people that like to keep track of their board games and their scores. 
It is very useful because it keeeps the information and allows you to retrieve it afterwards.
There are a lot of features that will be added later.
