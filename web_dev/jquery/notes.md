# 2 Hours for JQuery
..* Time: 2 hours
..* Breaks: Cool pomodoro breaks (every 25 min)
..* Resources: Javascript & Jquery by John Duckett
..* Also: code along some of what is learnt with the book
..* Also: write down general jquery syntax on notebook
..* Resources: Find cheat sheet and bookmark it


It took me 2 pomodoros to read through the book. I was tired by the second one. It was useful to get a feel of what I can do and how it looks like. I coded a long but not too much, especially at the end since I wanted to get through with it. 
I took notes of general ways to do certan things that I think will be useful later on.
Then I played around with what I learned. 
For me the most efective is writing it down in my notebook so I can find it if I can't remember exactly, but writing it somehow makes me remember better. 


I found a [cheat sheet](https://cdn.woorkup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jQuery-1.5-Visual-Cheat-Sheet.pdf)
