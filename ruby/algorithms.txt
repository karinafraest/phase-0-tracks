This algorithm assumes many things. The robot has light and sound sensors, wheels, and an extendible arms. It also knows where it is at.
The path has been marked on the floor for the robot to step.
The elevator has sounds. If it goes down it dings once, if it goes up it dings twice. It will ding once every floor.

2. Robot goes to blue x (begining position).
3. Robot checks if he has to go up (floor >current) or down (floor < current)
4. Robot lifts its arm depending on the button it has to push.
