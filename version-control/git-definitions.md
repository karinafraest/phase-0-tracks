# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?**
It is a way to save changes done over time.
  Why is it useful?
It is very useful to retrieve a specific version later. It is like a checkpoint and can be used in case there is something wrong in later versions. 
* **What is a branch and why would you use one?**
A branch is a copy of the project at a certain point (version) which you can modify without affecting the master branch. You can work on them and then if you want you can merge them with the master. 
* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**
Commits are save points in a project. They take all the information as is and save them with a specific key to retrieve later. They must include a commit message that specifies the changes that have been made and why. They should be self explanatory. If only you understand them they are no good.
* **What is a merge conflict?**
It is a type of conflict that occurs when there are two or more changes on the same line of a file. This conflicts have to be resolved by you, but git lets you know and shows you what is conflicting and where each conflicting changes come from.
